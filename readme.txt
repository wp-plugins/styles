== Frequently Asked Questions == 

= Why is this plugin free? =

We believe life is better when we work together. :) Support for WordPress default themes, like TwentyTwelve and TwentyThirteen, will always be free. Continued development in Styles will be supported by:

* Plugins for additional themes
* Plugins for add-on features
* Premium support and updates
* Documentation for using Styles in your own themes

= Does Styles support my theme? =

Maybe! We have additional themes available available at [StylesPlugin.com](http://stylesplugin.com). If you don't find your theme there, [watch this walkthrough](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxj61Fojm1RGevBh10U2qCqjwoH4Awo-P) for a developer's guide on how to add support. Adding one option takes only one line of code.

= I'd like to distribute a theme add-on I created for Styles =

If you [watched the walkthrough](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxj61Fojm1RGevBh10U2qCqjwoH4Awo-P) and created an add-on for Styles, please share it with others. It's our goal to make the lives of theme developers and end-users much, much easier.

If you would like to sell your add-on at [stylesplugin.com](http://stylesplugin.com), get in touch! Email us at `styles (at) stylesplugin.com` or find us on Twitter as [@stylesplugin](http://twitter.com/stylesplugin).

= Will this plugin slow down my site? =

No! Styles is very careful about only loading what is needed to get its job done. Once you're done editing, stylesheets are cached and loaded for your sites users as quickly as possible.
